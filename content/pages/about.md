Hello / Boujour / Ni Hao ðŸ‘‹ I am a developer based in BC, Canada. I enjoy working with technologies, learning in general and making things happen in a collaborative and transparent environment. I recently decided to move my process of collecting notes and writing down thoughts to a technical blog space. Hope you like what you see here!
